        <h2>Why SHA-256 and SHA-512?</h2>
        <p>
            The SHA-2 family of hash functions includes algorithms like SHA-256 and SHA-512, which are widely used for cryptographic security. Both algorithms produce fixed-size output (256 bits for SHA-256 and 512 bits for SHA-512) from an input message of arbitrary length.
        </p>
        <h3>SHA-256</h3>
        <p>
            - **Output Size**: 256 bits (32 bytes).<br>
            - **Security**: SHA-256 is widely used in blockchain, digital signatures, certificate generation, and SSL/TLS certificates.<br>
            - **Performance**: Generally faster than SHA-512 on 32-bit systems, as it requires fewer resources.<br>
            - **Use Cases**: It is the standard for most applications requiring secure hash values, like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various other cryptographic applications.
        </p>
        
        <h3>SHA-512</h3>
        <p>
            - **Output Size**: 512 bits (64 bytes).<br>
            - **Security**: Similar to SHA-256, but with a larger output size, which increases security against certain types of attacks.<br>
            - **Performance**: SHA-512 is optimized for 64-bit systems and is faster on these platforms, due to its larger block size (1024 bits compared to SHA-256's 512 bits). On 32-bit systems, it may be slower than SHA-256.<br>
            - **Use Cases**: SHA-512 is used where higher security is needed, or for systems with 64-bit processors (e.g., servers, large-scale enterprise applications).
