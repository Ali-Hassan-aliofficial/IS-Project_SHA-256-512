        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a cryptographic hash function designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in 2001. It is widely used in security protocols, including TLS/SSL, digital signatures, and blockchain technology. The SHA-2 family includes several hash functions with different output lengths: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, and others. Among them, SHA-256 and SHA-512 are the most widely used.
